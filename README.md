# Uniform_sampling_ui_python_Tkinter_project
Helps to resample and merge two or more csv data having two columns one of a index (here DEPTH) that will be common in both and other the different data column. Sampling points in the different files may be different. But the data must be sorted in the index, i.e., if depth column is my index then it should be either in ascending or descending orde
